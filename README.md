# AI Camp 2024

These are some of the projects and implimentations I made during a Introduction to AI camp I took in middle school. 
I learned about informed search, state representation, CSPs, MDPs, Minimax, Expectimax, MCTS, and other AI related topics. 

In this repository, there are implimentations of Minimax and Expectimax, some CSPs, and some fun projects.
